# dotfiles

My personal config files.

## Disclaimer

This repository contains my personal config files for various applications.
This is first and foremost designed for my own needs (backup / bootstrapping
from various places).
I would ***not*** advise to run the Justfile as it will forcefully link everything, plus a whole lot more.

## Installation

- install `just`: get it [here](https://just.systems/man/en/packages.html)
- `just` prints the available recipes
- `just bootstrap` to install everything

## Goals

- Maintain a coherent config backup / bootstrap
- Provide support for bépo (French dvorak variant, more about it [here](http://bepo.fr/wiki/Accueil))
- Provide standardized color scheme for various applications
